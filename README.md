# Python Blender Script
I wrote this script to generate a random short animation in Blender 2.9 

This script creates 240 cubes with random locations and scales. I attached emission materials to each cube and animated the cubes to fly out in different directions.
The camera is also programmed to move along the y-axis. The images are set to render in 4K! For more information take a look at the code!
